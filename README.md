# Wii U things
Things I made (or found?) when playing around with the Wii U

* `wiiu_cdndownload.py` - download titles from Nintendo CDN, including cetk (ticket) for system titles/game updates/etc
* `wiiu_decrypt.py` - decrypt titles from Nintendo CDN; requires Wii U Common Key, plus given encrypted titlekey if there is no cetk file
